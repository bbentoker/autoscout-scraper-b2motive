First ones autoscout id 99f34d1e-8209-4a2c-b057-d9f288673beb
Second ones autoscout id ce63a7f6-0f09-4cdd-a051-969b71bb4f89

Lets say one of them is deleted and added again , this will cause it to have a new autoscout id.
And when our scraper sees this new listing it will look at the id - lets say xxxxxxx- since we dont have any listing with this id
it will check if there is an identical listing based on brand,model, seller , location andÂ km and will find one of the two listings above , then it will update one of them with the new id and mark it as not sold.
which is correct.
